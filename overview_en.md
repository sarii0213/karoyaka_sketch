# üïäÔ∏èApp to help you establish organized life

## Overview
- This app will support you to establish the routine to get rid of your unnecessary possessions
- by enhancing the refreshing feeling of reducing your personal belongings (visualize the progress of your activity)
- by lightening the complication of the letting go activity (give you some hints of what and how to get rid of)

## Background
- There are full of illusions derived from the marketing strategy such as "I can feel happy if I am surrounded by so many things" or "If I get this, I will gain a superior status"
- Many people unknowingly believe these thoughts and live a life controlled by things around them
  - the life controlled by things: you have no idea where you put the thing so that you spend so much time and effort looking for your thing, thinking of the way to organize
- The more possessions you have, the higher the hurdles become to organize possessions
- If you establish the letting go routine, you will reduce your impulse purchases and it will get easier to maintain the simple, stress-free, and comfortable life

## Competitor analysis
- Similar services: Mainly in blog or video style. We can get information from tidying experts, Minimalists, Simplists but they are mostly in non-interactive ways.
- This app expresses the uniqueness and value by suggesting users the small steps which reflect the users' situations and displaying the effective UI so that users can feel the sense of accomplishment easily

## Expected user
- Don't like the cluttered room, but not good at tidying up
- Feel like rooms get messy too quickly after putting in so much effort organizing
- Admire Minimalists and Simplists but haven't taken action yet

## Hurdles that users face
- Don't know what to do first
- Cannot establish the habit to declutter or reduce personal belongings
- Accustomed so much to keeping many items that it seems too hard to distinguish which items to let go from their lives
- Everything seems troublesome

## Solutions for the hurdles
### Policy
- "one item per day" 
- Practice the letting go activity every day

### Features to support the policy
- Register and show the lists of items you want to get rid of
  - To remove the barriers that users feel, split complex tasks in two: the process of distinguishing and that of actually disposing of
  - Users can take a note whenever you think of something you can get rid of
  - Suggests the way to get rid of (how to dispose of or where to take something)
  - (Users can also take a note for the actions they want to quit) 
  - Utilize AI technology such as "Identify Anything Lens Camera" to lower barriers for users who dislike the tedium of entering information

- Alert (email notification)
  - Remind users to establish "one item per day" routine

  - Display lists of Minimalists' quotes
  - Place like button so that users can make their favorite quotes stand out

- Register and show the lists of items you have got rid of 
  - Users register the item's genre, the place the item was kept, the name, photo/icon, and the reason why they let it go
  - Items you've got rid of disappear from your sight, but the history remains in the app so that you can feel the sense of your effort you have made every day
  - As you go through the letting go activity, you will have a clearer sense of what you can get rid of, which makes it easier to make decisions to throw away unnecessary possessions
  - Users can get tips from other users' lists of items they have got rid of

- Point system (visual reinforcement)
  - A system that users can enjoy letting go activity as if it is one kind of game
  - example 1) Shows the actual numbers of weight, volume, area that have cleared up from the space by letting things go

  - example 3) Calendar charts that show if you have done the letting activity each day
